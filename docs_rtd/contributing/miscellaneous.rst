Release checklist
-----------------------------------------

GX core team members use this checklist to ship releases.

1. If this is a major release (incrementing either the first or second version number) the manual acceptance testing must be completed.

  * This `private google doc <https://docs.google.com/document/d/16QJPSCawEkwuEjShZeHa01TlQm9nbUwS6GwmFewJ3EY>`_ outlines the procedure. (Note this will be made public eventually)

2. Merge all approved PRs into ``develop``.
3. Make a new branch from ``develop`` called something like ``release-prep-2020-06-01``.
4. In this branch, update the version number in the ``great_expectations/deployment_version`` file.

5. Update the ``changelog.rst``: move all things under the ``Develop`` heading under a new heading with the new release number. NOTE: You should remove the ``Develop`` heading for the released version, it will be replaced in step #12.

  * Verify that any changes to requirements are specifically identified in the changelog
  * Double check the grouping / order of changes matches [BREAKING], [FEATURE], [BUGFIX], [DOCS], [MAINTENANCE] and that all changes since the last release are mentioned or summarized in a bullet.
  * Make sure to shout out community contributions in the changelog! E.g. after the change title add ``(thanks @<contributor_id>)``

6. Submit this as a PR against ``develop``
7. After successful checks, get it approved and merged.
8. Update your local branches and switch to main: ``git fetch --all; git checkout main; git pull``.
9. Merge the now-updated ``develop`` branch into ``main`` and trigger the release: ``git merge origin/develop; git push``
10. Wait for all the builds to complete. The builds should include several test jobs and a deploy job, which handles the actual publishing of code to pypi. You can watch the progress of these builds on Azure.
11. Check `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/great-expectations/#history>`__ for the new release
12. Create an annotated git tag:

  * Run ``git tag -a <<VERSION>> -m "<<VERSION>>"`` with the correct new version.
  * Push the tag up by running ``git push origin <<VERSION>>`` with the correct new version.
  * Merge ``main`` into ``develop`` so that the tagged commit becomes part of the history for ``develop``: ``git checkout develop; git pull; git merge main``
  * On develop, add a new "Develop" section header to changelog.rst, and push the updated file with message "Update changelog for develop"

13. `Create the release on GitHub <https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/releases>`__ with the version number. Copy the changelog notes into the release notes, and update any rst-specific links to use github issue numbers.

  * The deploy step will automatically create a draft for the release.
  * Generally, we use the name of the tag (Ex: "0.11.2") as the release title.

14. Notify kyle@superconductive.com about any community-contributed PRs that should be celebrated.
15. Socialize the release on GX slack by copying the changelog with an optional nice personal message (thank people if you can)
16. Review and merge the automatically-generated PR for `conda-forge/great-expectations-feedstock <https://github.com/conda-forge/great-expectations-feedstock/pulls>`__, updating requirements as necessary and verifying the build status.

  * To list requirements changed since a previous version of GX, you can run ``git diff <<old_tag_e.g._0.12.6>>..<<new_tag_e.g._0.12.7>> -- requirements.txt``. If there are differences, update the requirements section of ``recipe/meta.yaml``. This is an important step as this is not done automatically when the PR is generated.
  * In most cases, the PR will change the SHA and version number. Check the commits for other changes, they may be maintenance changes from the Conda dev team which are OK to merge.
  * Review all items on the conda-forge CI system and PR checklist. The active conda-forge community frequently updates build processes and testing, and may help discover issues not observed in our pypi deployment process.
  * If you need to re-run a failing build and don't have appropriate permissions or you don't have permissions to merge please refer to the Account Permissions Overview on the superconductive `internal wikiwiki <https://github.com/superconductive/wiki/wiki>`__ for who to ask. Other conda-forge community partners are extremely responsive and may be able to help resolve issues quickly.

17. Check for open issues in the `GX conda-forge repository <https://github.com/conda-forge/great-expectations-feedstock/issues>`__. If there are open issues that do not have a corresponding issue in the main `GX repo <https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/issues>`__, please create an issue in the GX repo with a link to the corresponding conda issue (e.g. issue `#2021 <https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/issues/2021>`__). This allows us to internally triage and track the issue.
18. Celebrate! You have successfully released a new version of Great Expectations!!

Beta Release Notes

* To ship a beta release, follow the above checklist, but use the branch name ``v0.11.x`` as the equivalent of ``main`` and ``v0.11.x-develop`` as the equivalent of ``develop``
* Ship the release using beta version numbers when updating the ``great_expectations/deployment_version`` and when creating the annotated tag (e.g. `0.11.0b0`)


Issue Tags
-----------------------------------------

We use ``stalebot`` to automatically tag issues without activity as ``stale``, and close them if no response is received in one week. Adding the ``stalebot-exempt`` tag will prevent the bot from trying to close the issue.

Additionally, we try to add tags to indicate the status of key discussion elements:

* ``help wanted`` covers issues where we have not prioritized the request, but believe the feature is useful and so we would welcome community contributors to help accelerate development.
* ``enhacement`` and ``expectation-request`` indicate discussion of potential new features for Great Expectations
* ``good first issue`` indicates a small-ish task that would be a good way to begin making contributions to Great Expectations

### Batches and Batch Requests: Design Motivation

You do not generally need to access the metadata that Great Expectations uses to define a Batch.
Typically, a user need specify only the Batch Request. The Batch Request will describe what data Great
Expectations should fetch, including the name of the Data Asset and other identifiers (see more detail below).

A **Batch Definition** includes all the information required to precisely identify a set of data from the external data
source that should be translated into a Batch. One or more BatchDefinitions are always *returned* from the Datasource,
as a result of processing the Batch Request. A Batch Definition includes several key components:

* **Batch Identifiers**: contains information that uniquely identifies a specific batch from the Data Asset, such as the
  delivery date or query time.
* **Engine Passthrough**: contains information that will be passed directly to the Execution Engine as part of the Batch
  Spec.
* **Sample Definition**: contains information about sampling or limiting done on the Data Asset to create a Batch.

:::info Best practice
We recommend that you make every Data Asset Name **unique** in your Data Context configuration. Even though a Batch
Definition includes the Data Connector Name and Datasource Name, choosing a unique Data Asset name makes it
easier to navigate quickly through Data Docs and ensures your logical data assets are not confused with any particular
view of them provided by an Execution Engine.
:::

A **Batch Spec** is an Execution Engine-specific description of the Batch. The Data Connector is responsible for working
with the Execution Engine to translate the Batch Definition into a spec that enables Great Expectations to access the
data using that Execution Engine.

Finally, the **BatchMarkers** are additional pieces of metadata that can be useful to understand reproducibility, such
as the time the batch was constructed, or hash of an in-memory DataFrame.

### Batches and Batch Requests: A full journey

Let's follow the outline in this diagram to follow the journey from BatchRequest to Batch list:

![Image](https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/e70e54b6-60af-4a30-8626-f61dc3b3c3ee/image.png)

1. A Datasource's `get_batch_list_from_batch_request` method is passed a BatchRequest.
    * A BatchRequest can include `data_connector_query` params with values relative to the latest Batch (e.g. the "latest" slice).
      Conceptually, this enables "fetch the latest Batch" behavior. It is the key thing that differentiates
      a BatchRequest, which does NOT necessarily uniquely identify the Batch(es) to be fetched, from a
      BatchDefinition.
    * The BatchRequest can also include a section called `batch_spec_passthrough` to make it easy to directly
      communicate parameters to a specific Execution Engine.
    * When resolved, the BatchRequest may point to many BatchDefinitions and Batches.
    * BatchRequests can be defined as dictionaries, or by instantiating a BatchRequest object.


```python name="tests/integration/docusaurus/connecting_to_your_data/how_to_create_a_batch_of_data_from_an_in_memory_pandas_dataframe.py runtime_batch_request_with_path"
```
    
2. The Datasource finds the Data Connector indicated by the BatchRequest, and uses it to obtain a BatchDefinition list.

```python
DataSource.get_batch_list_from_batch_request(batch_request=batch_request)
```

* A BatchDefinition resolves any ambiguity in BatchRequest to uniquely identify a single Batch to be
  fetched. BatchDefinitions are Datasource -- and Execution Engine -- agnostic. That means that its parameters may depend on
  the configuration of the Datasource, but they do not otherwise depend on the specific Data Connector type (e.g.
  filesystem, SQL, etc.) or Execution Engine being used to instantiate Batches.

```yaml
BatchDefinition
    datasource: str
    data_connector: str
    data_asset_name: str
    batch_identifiers:
        ** contents depend on the configuration of the DataConnector **
        ** provides a persistent, unique identifier for the Batch within the context of the Data Asset **
```

3. The Datasource then requests that the Data Connector transform the BatchDefinition list into BatchData, BatchSpec, and BatchMarkers.

4. When the Data Connector receives this request, it first builds the BatchSpec, then calls its Execution Engine to create BatchData and BatchMarkers.
  * A `BatchSpec` is a set of specific instructions for the Execution Engine to fetch specific data; it is the
    ExecutionEngine-specific version of the BatchDefinition. For example, a `BatchSpec` could include the path to files,
    information about headers, or other configuration required to ensure the data is loaded properly for validation.
  * Batch Markers are metadata that can be used to calculate performance characteristics, ensure reproducibility of Validation Results, and provide indicators of the state of the underlying data system.

5. After the Data Connector returns the BatchSpec, BatchData, and BatchMarkers, the Datasource builds and returns a list of Batches.

In this guide's examples, all of our data is assumed to be in the `base_directory` folder.  Therefore, you will not need to add an entry for `glob_directive` to your configuration.  However, if you were to include the example `glob_directive` from above, your full configuration would currently look like:

```python name="spark inferred datasource_config post glob_directive definition"
```

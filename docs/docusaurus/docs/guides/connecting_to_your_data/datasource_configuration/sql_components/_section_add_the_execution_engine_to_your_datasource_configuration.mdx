<PartAddTheBackendExecutionEngineToYourDatasourceConfiguration backend="SQL" />

For the purposes of this guide, these will consist of the `SqlAlchemyExecutionEngine` found at `great_expectations.execution_engine`.  The `execution_engine` key and its corresponding value will therefore look like this:

```python name="sql datasource define execution_engine class_name and module_name"
```

Additionally, your `execution_engine` dictionary will require a values for either `connection_string` or `credentials`.  You will only need to use one of these keys as they each serve the same purpose: to provide the parameters necessary for the SqlAlchemyExecutionEngine to connect to your desired database.  For the purposes of this guide we will use the `connection_string` key, the value of which will be the string representation of the information necessary to connect to your SQL database.  At this point your configuration should look like:

```python name="sql datasource define CONNECTION_STRING"
```

:::tip
Your connection string will vary depending on the type of SQL database you are connecting to.  For more information on how to configure your connection string, please see [the appropriate guide for connecting to a specific Database](../#database).

After adding the above snippets to your Datasource configuration, your full configuration dictionary should now look like:

```python name="sql datasource configuration post execution engine defined"
```

:::tip Tip: Using `credentials` instead of `connection_string`

The `credentials` key uses a dictionary to provide the elements of your connection string as separate, individual values.  For information on how to populate the `credentials` dictionary and how to configure your `great_expectations.yml` project config file to populate credentials from either a YAML file or a secret manager, please see our guide on [How to configure credentials](../../setup/configuring_data_contexts/how_to_configure_credentials).

:::info Info: Additional (optional) Execution Engine keys

In addition to substituting `credentials` for `connection_string`, there are a few other optional keys that you can add to your `execution_engine` dictionary.

The first of these is the optional key `create_temp_table`.  Creating a temp table to improve query efficiency is the default behaviour of the `SqlAlchemyExecutionEngine`.  However, you can change this to `False` if you don't have the permissions to create a temp table on the database you are working with.

The other valid keys are not actually defined by the Great Expectations code.  Instead, any other key/value pairs that you add to the Execution Engine configuration will be passed directly to SqlAlchemy's `create_engine(...)` method.  This allows you to fully leverage all the capabilities supported by SqlAlchemy through that method.

For more information on what keys `create_engine(...)` will accept as parameters and how you can utilize this feature, please refer to [SqlAlchemy's documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/).

Runtime Data Connectors put a wrapper around a single Batch of data, and therefore do not support Data Asset configurations that permit the return of more than one Batch of data.  In fact, since you will use a Batch Request to pass in or specify the data that a Runtime Data Connector uses, there is no need to specify a Data Asset configuration at all.

Instead, you will provide a `batch_identifiers` list which will be used to attach identifying information to a returned Batch so that you can reference the same data again in the future.

For this example, lets assume we have the follo√èwing tables in our database:
- `yellow_tripdata_sample_2020-01`
- `yellow_tripdata_sample_2020-02`
- `yellow_tripdata_sample_2020-03`

With a Runtime Data Connector you won't actually refer to them in your configuration!  As mentioned above, you will provide the name of one of those tables to the Data Connector as part of a Batch Request.

Therefore, the table names are inconsequential to your Runtime Data Connector's configuration.  In fact, the `batch_identifiers` that you define in your Runtime Data Connector's configuration can be completely arbitrary. However, it is advised you name them after something meaningful regarding your data or the circumstances under which you will be accessing your data.

For instance, let's assume you are getting a daily update to your data, and so you are running daily validations.  You could then choose to identify your Runtime Data Connector's Batches by the timestamp at which they are requested.

To do this, you would simply add a `batch_timestamp` entry in your `batch_identifiers` list.  This would look like:

```python name="runtime sql data asset define batch_identifiers"
```

Then, when you create your Batch Request you would populate the `batch_timestamp` value in its `batch_identifiers` dictionary with the value of the current date and time.  This will attach the current date and time to the returned Batch, allowing you to reference the Batch again in the future even if the current data (the data that would be provided by the Runtime Data Connector if you requested a new Batch) had changed.

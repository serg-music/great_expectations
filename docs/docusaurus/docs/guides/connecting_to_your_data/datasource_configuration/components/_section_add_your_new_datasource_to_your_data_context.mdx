Now that you have verified that you have a valid configuration you can add your new Datasource to your Data Context with the command:

```python name="add your datasource to your data_context"
```

:::caution

If the value of `datasource_config["name"]` corresponds to a Datasource that is already defined in your Data Context, then using the above command will overwrite the existing Datasource.

:::tip

If you want to ensure that you only add a Datasource when it won't overwrite an existing one, you can use the following code instead:

```python name="add your datasource to your data_context only if it does not already exit"
```

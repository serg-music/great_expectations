A `RuntimeDataConnector` is used to connect to an in-memory dataframe or path.  The dataframe or path used for a `RuntimeDataConnector` is therefore passed to the `RuntimeDataConnector` as part of a Batch Request, rather than being a static part of the `RuntimeDataConnector`'s configuration.

A Runtime Data Connector will always only return one Batch of data: the _current_ data that was passed in or specified as part of a Batch Request.  This means that a `RuntimeDataConnector` does not define Data Assets like an `InferredDataConnector` or a `ConfiguredDataConnector` would.

Instead, a Runtime Data Connector's configuration will provides a way for you to attach identifying values to a returned Batch of data so that the data _as it was at the time it was returned_ can be referred to again in the future.

For more information on configuring a Batch Request for a Pandas Runtime Data Connector, please see our guide on [how to create a Batch of data from an in-memory Spark or Pandas dataframe or path](../../how_to_create_a_batch_of_data_from_an_in_memory_spark_or_pandas_dataframe.md).

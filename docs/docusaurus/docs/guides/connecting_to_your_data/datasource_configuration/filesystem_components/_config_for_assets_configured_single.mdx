Because you are explicitly defining each Data Asset in a `ConfiguredAssetDataConnector`, it is very easy to define one that can will only have one Batch.

The simplest way to do this is to define a Data Asset with a `pattern` value that does not contain any regex special characters which would match on more than one value.

For this example, lets assume we have the following files in our `data` directory:
- `yellow_tripdata_sample_2020-01.csv`
- `yellow_tripdata_sample_2020-02.csv`
- `yellow_tripdata_sample_2020-03.csv`

In this case, we want to define a single Data Asset for each month.  To do so, we will need an entry in the `assets` dictionary for each month, as well: one for each Data Asset we want to create.

Let's walk through the creation of the Data Asset for January's data.

First, you need to add an empty dictionary entry into the `assets` dictionary.  Since the key you associate with this entry will be treated as the Data Asset's name, go ahead and name it `yellow_trip_data_jan`.

At this point, your entry in the `assets dictionary will look like:

```python name="empty_data_asset_configuration_configured_single_batch"
```

Next, you will need to define the `pattern` value and `group_names` value for this Data Asset.

Since you want this Data Asset to only match the file `yellow_tripdata_sample_2020-01.csv` value for the `pattern` key should be one that does not contain any regex special characters that can match on more than one value.  An example follows:

```python name="pattern_for_single_batch_configured_data_asset_configuration"
```

:::note
The pattern we defined contains a regex group, even though we logically don't need a group to identify the desired Batch in a Data Asset that can only return one Batch.  This is because Great Expectations currently does not permit `pattern` to be defined without also having `group_names` defined.  Thus, in the example above you are creating a group that corresponds to `01` so that there is a valid group to associate a `group_names` entry with.
:::

Since none of the characters in this regex can possibly match more than one value, the only file that can possibly be matched is the one you want it to match: `yellow_tripdata_sample_2020-01.csv`.  This batch will also be associated with the Batch Identifier `01`, but you won't need to use that to specify the Batch in a Batch Request as it is the only Batch that this Data Asset is capable of returning.

To correspond to the single group that was defined in your regex, you will define a single entry in the list for the `group_names` key.  Since the `assets` dictionary key is used for this Data Asset's name, you can give this group a name relevant to what it is matching on:

```python name="group_names for single batch configured assets configuration"
```

Put entirely together, your `assets` entry will look like:

```python name="full_data_asset_for_single_batch_configured_data_connector"
```

Looking back at our sample files, this entry will result in the `ConfiguredAssetFilesystemDataConnector` providing one Data Asset, which can be accessed by the name `yellow_tripdata_jan`.  In future workflows you will be able to refer to this Data Asset and its single corresponding Batch by providing that name.

With all of these values put together into a single dictionary, your Data Connector configuration will look like this:

```python name="full_single_batch_configured_data_connector_configuration"
```

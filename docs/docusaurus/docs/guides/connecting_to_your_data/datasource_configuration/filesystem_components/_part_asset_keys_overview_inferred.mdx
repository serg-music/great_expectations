In an Inferred Asset Data Connector for filesystem data, a regular expression is used to group the files into Batches for a Data Asset.  This is done with the value we will define for the Data Connector's `default_regex` key.  The value for this key will consist of a dictionary that contains two values:
- `pattern`: This is the regex pattern that will define your Data Asset's potential Batch or Batches.
- `group_names`: This is a list of names that correspond to the groups you defined in `pattern`'s regular expression.

The `pattern` in `default_regex` will be matched against the files in your `base_directory`, and everything that matches against the first group in your regex will become a Batch in a Data Asset that possesses the name of the matching text.  Any files that have a matching string for the first group will become Batches in the same Data Asset.

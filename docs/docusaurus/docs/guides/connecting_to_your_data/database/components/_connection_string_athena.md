In order for Great Expectations to connect to Athena, you will need to provide a connection string.  To determine your connection string, reference the examples below and the [PyAthena documentation](https://github.com/laughingman7743/PyAthena#sqlalchemy).

The following urls don't include credentials as it is recommended to use either the instance profile or the boto3 configuration file.

If you want Great Expectations to connect to your Athena instance (without specifying a particular database), the URL should be:

```bash
awsathena+rest://@athena.{region}.amazonaws.com/?s3_staging_dir={s3_path}
```

Note the url parameter "s3_staging_dir" needed for storing query results in S3.

If you want Great Expectations to connect to a particular database inside your Athena, the URL should be:

```bash
awsathena+rest://@athena.{region}.amazonaws.com/{database}?s3_staging_dir={s3_path}
```

:::tip Tip: Using `credentials` instead of `connection_string`

The `credentials` key uses a dictionary to provide the elements of your connection string as separate, individual values.  For information on how to populate the `credentials` dictionary and how to configure your `great_expectations.yml` project config file to populate credentials from either a YAML file or a secret manager, please see our guide on [How to configure credentials](../../../setup/configuring_data_contexts/how_to_configure_credentials.md).

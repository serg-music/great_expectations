title: How to use the Great Expectations command line interface (CLI)
---

The Great Expectations command line is organized using a **`<NOUN> <VERB>`** syntax.
This guide is organized by nouns (datasource, suite, docs) then verbs (new, list, edit, etc).

## Basics

You can get a list of Great Expectations commands available to you by typing `great_expectations --help`.
Each noun command and each verb sub-command has a description, and should help you find the thing you need.

:::info [OPTIONAL_TEXT_HERE]
All Great Expectations commands have help text which you can access by adding `--help` to the end of a command. For example, by running `great_expectations suite new --help` you'll see help output for that specific command.

By running `great_expectations --help`, you will see all top-level commands that are available in the CLI:

```bash
$ great_expectations --help
Usage: great_expectations [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

You can further explore available options and commands with the `--help` flag, for example:

  Datasource operations

```

An existing data context can be provided with the variable `GX_HOME`, for example:

```bash
export GX_HOME="${HOME}/ge_dir_1/great_expectations"
great_expectations datasource list
```


## Shell autocompletion for the CLI

If you want to enable autocompletion for the Great Expectations CLI, you can execute following commands in your shell (or add them to your .bashrc/.zshrc or ~/.config/fish/completions/):

```bash title="bash"
$ eval "$(_GREAT_EXPECTATIONS_COMPLETE=source_bash great_expectations)"
```

```zsh title="zsh"
$ eval "$(_GREAT_EXPECTATIONS_COMPLETE=source_zsh great_expectations)"
```

```fish title="fish"
$ eval (env _GREAT_EXPECTATIONS_COMPLETE=source_fish great_expectations)
```

(you'll have to create a ~/.config/fish/completions/great_expectations.fish file).

Alternatively, if you don't want the eval command to slow down your shell startup time, you can instead add the commands as a script to your shell profile. For more info, see the official [Click documentation](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/bashcomplete/)

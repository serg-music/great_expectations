In this guide's examples, all of our data is assumed to be in the `base_directory` folder.  Therefore, you will not need to add an entry for `glob_directive` to your configuration.  However, if you were to include the example `glob_directive` from above, your full configuration would currently look like:

```python
datasource_config: dict = {
    "name": "my_datasource_name",
    "class_name": "Datasource",
    "module_name": "great_expectations.datasource",
    "execution_engine": {
        "class_name": "SparkDFExecutionEngine",
        "module_name": "great_expectations.execution_engine",
    },
    "data_connectors": {
        "name_of_my_inferred_data_connector": {
            "class_name": "InferredAssetFilesystemDataConnector",
            "base_directory": "./data",
            "glob_directive": "*/*",
            "default_regex": {},
            "batch_spec_passthrough": {},
        }
    }
}
```

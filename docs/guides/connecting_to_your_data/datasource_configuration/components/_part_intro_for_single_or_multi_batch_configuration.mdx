This means that when configuring your Data Connector's regular expression, you have the option to implement it so that the Data Connector is only capable of returning a single Batch per Data Asset, or so that it is capable of returning multiple Batches grouped into individual Data Assets.  Each type of configuration is useful in certain cases, so we will provide examples of both.

If you are uncertain as to which type of configuration is best for your use case, please refer to our guide on [how to choose between working with a single or multiple Batches of data](../../how_to_choose_between_working_with_a_single_or_multiple_batches_of_data.md).

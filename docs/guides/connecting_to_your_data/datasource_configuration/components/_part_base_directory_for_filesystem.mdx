For the base directory, you will want to put the relative path of your data from the folder that contains your Data Context.  In this example we will use the same path that was used in the [Getting Started Tutorial, Step 2: Connect to Data](../../../../tutorials/getting_started/tutorial_connect_to_data.md).  Since we are manually entering this value rather than letting the CLI generate it, the key/value pair will look like:

```python name="inferred data connector add base_directory"
        "base_directory": "../data",
```

The first key that you will need to define for your new Datasource is its `name`.  You will use this to reference the Datasource in future workflows.  It can be anything you want it to be, but ideally you will name it something relevant to the data that it interacts with.

For the purposes of this example, we will name this Datasource:

```python
    "name": "my_datasource_name",
```

You should, however, name your Datsource something more relevant to your data.

At this point, your configuration should now look like:

```python
datasource_config: dict = {
    "name": "my_datasource_name",  # Preferably name it something relevant
}
```

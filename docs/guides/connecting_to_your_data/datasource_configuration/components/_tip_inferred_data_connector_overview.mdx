The `InferredDataConnector` is ideal for:
- quickly setting up a Datasource and getting access to data
- diving straight in to working with Great Expectations
- initial data discovery and introspection

However, the `InferredDataConnector` allows less control over the definitions of your Data Assets than the `ConfiguredAssetDataConnector` provides.

If you are at the point of building a repeatable workflow, we encourage using the `ConfiguredAssetDataConnector` instead.

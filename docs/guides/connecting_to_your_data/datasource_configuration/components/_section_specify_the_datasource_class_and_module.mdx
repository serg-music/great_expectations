The `class_name` and `module_name` for your Datasource will almost always indicate the `Datasource` class found at `great_expectations.datasource`.  You may replace this with a specialized subclass, or a custom class, but for almost all regular purposes these two default values will suffice.  For the purposes of this guide, add those two values to their corresponding keys.

```python
    "class_name": "Datasource",
    "module_name": "great_expectations.datasource",
```

Your full configuration should now look like:

```python
datasource_config: dict = {
    "name": "my_datasource_name",  # Preferably name it something relevant
    "class_name": "Datasource",
    "module_name": "great_expectations.datasource",
}
```

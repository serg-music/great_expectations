Now that you have a full Datasource configuration, you can confirm that it is valid by testing it with the `.test_yaml_config(...)` method.  To do this, execute the Python code:

```python
data_context.test_yaml_config(yaml.dump(datasource_config))
```

When executed, `test_yaml_config` will instantiate the component described by the yaml configuration that is passed in and then run a self check procedure to verify that the component works as expected.

For a Datasource, this includes:
- confirming that the connection works
- gathering a list of available Data Assets
- verifying that at least one Batch can be fetched from the Datasource

For more information on the `.test_yaml_config(...)` method, please see our guide on [how to configure `DataContext` components using `test_yaml_config`](../../../setup/configuring_data_contexts/how_to_configure_datacontext_components_using_test_yaml_config.md).

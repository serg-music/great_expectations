## Great Expectations Semantic Types Expectations
A collection of Expectations to validate Semantically Typed Data with Great Expectations.

### What Are Semantic Types?

Semantic Types categorize data by the type of information it represents. For example, consider a column with STRING data types. How do you know what the data means? You could be looking at a list of streets, cities, counties, etc. Without background information, it can be hard to know what you're looking at. That's where Semantic Types come in. The entityâ€™s Semantic Type defines how it should be interpreted.

### Why should we test on Semantic Types?

Testing on these Semantic Types allows us to create more explicit, fit-for-purpose tests, unlocking questions like `Does this column contain US State abbreviations?` instead of asking `Does this column contain strings in the set [AL, AL, AR, AZ...]`

### How do you know when data entities are good candidates for Semantic Types testing?

Any data that you can tie to a real-world category or reference is ideal for this kind of test, e.g., phone numbers, ZIP codes, countries, coordinates, URLs, email addresses, etc.

This package contains a number of Expectations to support validation of Semantically Typed Data.

After running `docker compose up -d` in this directory to start the mssql container, to run tests you'll need to create the `test_ci` database. An easy way to do this if you are using docker desktop is to navigate to the container and open an interactive CLI session. In that session, run `/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -U sa -P "ReallyStrongPwd1234%^&*" -Q "CREATE DATABASE test_ci;"` to set up the `test_ci` database. Then you can run mssql specific tests via `pytest --mssql`.
